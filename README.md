A finance mobile app where you can manage your financial situations.

You can maintain your bills, credit cards, and deposits, and so on.

The work is still on progress and maintaining the states with Provider. I will follow the MVC Architecture for this project.

MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic. It emphasizes a separation between the software's business logic and display. This "separation of concerns" provides for a better division of labor and improved maintenance.
